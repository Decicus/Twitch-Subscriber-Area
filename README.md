# Twitch-Subscriber-Area
A PHP-based project to simplify a subscriber area for partnered streamers on Twitch.

# Introduction
The main idea came from a project I did for [IwinUloseLOL][http://www.twitch.tv/iwinuloselol], where his subscribers could get certain information from his website without having to PM him or something like that. They just clicked a button, authorized the application in the Twitch API and then they would get access if they were subscribed.

Moving further on, I made a [similar website](https://blacklist.rocks/) that would give access if someone was subscribed to any partnered streamer in [The Blacklist](http://www.twitch.tv/team/theblacklist). Meaning you would only have to be subscribed to one member to get access to the subscriber area.

The point of this project is to create something similar for others to use as well, but without having to know how to program it all.
